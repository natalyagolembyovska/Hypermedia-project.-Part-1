# Hypermedia-project.-Part-1

Part 1: Target user profile
  I've developed a resume template mainly for myself but it is also suitable for students like me. It contains substantial    information which can be helpful in a time when they are looking for a summer job or an internship. 

Part 2: Information architecture
  The CV has a clear and easily readable structure. At the header of the page the employer can find a picture of the user and their name stated in big bold letters. Also under a name there can be found users current job occupation and their preferred pronouns. 
  Then the page is divided into two columns. The far left column contains contact information,  such as phone number, email, social media tabs and address. Below it are briefly stated the academic achievements of the user and also the languages they speak (as well as level of speaking). And lastly below languages are some interests of the user.
The far right column consists of two parts: users profile where they can introduce themselves and the work experience part. In the Experience section there are clearly stated times of employment, place, position and duties.

Part 3: Visual design
  Visually the resume looks very clean, almost sterile. All is in the same font. Some titles are not black to bring some variety to the design but also to accentuate the attention on certain parts of the resume.
Contact Information and Interests are marked with corresponding icons making them easier to comprehend and more pleasing to eye.
  The color palette is incredibly simple. Dark color for titles #333, light colors for backgrounds #f9f9f9 and #fff, and vibrant blue and purples for accents and icons #93bef7 and #6062f0.
